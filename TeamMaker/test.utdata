Processes
Stackframe - holds argument, local variables and return information

Cpu contains
the instruction pointer (EIP): a reference to the next instruction to execute 
a stack pointer (ESP): a reference to the top of the stack 
a base pointer (EBP): a reference to the current stack frame
general purpose registers: used by a process to store data
(E)Instruction Pointer, (E)Stack Pointer, (E)Base Pointer

*malloc(size_t size), allocates data on heap. 	Calloc is same but reset

TODO:

Automatic Responses from Sheet to Java
Interrogation with Google API
https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/quickstart/java
GUI for input to balancing System
Crossboxes for pressing every player that’s playing
Add custom players (not regulars) for easying the algoritm
Add name and skillrating to these players
(Question) Should they be added to database? Yes? (test)
Presets for Overthrow, Inhouses etc (Inhouse 5v5 is default)
Balancing System
Make Balanced Algorithm handle: 
Amount of Teams
Amount of Players in every team
Game
More complex options to base teams of later on
Languages
Make users put in CS Rank and Dota MMR to translate into numbers
Will have to change comparison based on this (comparison with numbers)


Take into consideration how an average cs compares to a top cs
Is top worth a 3 and an average 2? Does it sound balanced
Allows for: (Sounds good atm, relies on players being good judgement)
Team 1: 3,3,2,2,1
Team 2: 3,2,2,2,2
PseudoRandom


Finished:
Add complete random option ( Should be used within inner levels of balanced between equally skilled tiers, all globals are randomly distributed)
JSON to Java
Added Rank and MMR system. Currently 1-6, requires testing
